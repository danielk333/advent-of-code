# Day 1 notes

Getting rust on arch was very simple, just `pacman -S rust`! 
Now my `rustc --version` gives me `rustc 1.65.0 (Arch Linux rust 1:1.65.0-1)`.

My first hello world was compiled and ran by `rustc main.rc -o main && ./main`.

Also the pacman installation came with cargo of course

```
> cargo --version
cargo 1.65.0
```

Creating a hello world cargo project instead allows me to compile and run with simply `cargo run`. 

Thats enough getting started. Time to solve day 1.
